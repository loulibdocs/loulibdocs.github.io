===================================================
Exponentially-Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) Filter
===================================================

The :code:`EWMAFilter` class is used to create an exponentially-weighted moving
average filter in order to remove noise from sensor data. The EWMA Filter is better for
data that needs to respond to rapid changes.

Creating an EWMA Filter
-----------------------

The constructor for :code:`EWMAFilter` contains two parameters: :code:`k` and :code:`startVal`.

The :code:`k` parameter is the weighting average and is used to determine how much weight is given to
each new reading. The value of :code:`k` should be between 0 and 1. A higher value of :code:`k` will
result in more responsive data, and a lower value of :code:`k` will result in smoother data.

The :code:`startVal` parameter is an optional parameter for the initial sensor reading. Providing
the initial sensor reading can make the filter a bit more accurate at the beginning. If a
:code:`startVal` is not provided, it will automatically be set to zero.

.. code-block:: cpp
	
	//create an EWMA filter for data where smoothness is more important
	LouLib::Filters::EWMAFilter smoothFilter(0.1);
	
	//create an EWMA filter for data where responsiveness is more important
	LouLib::Filters::EWMAFilter responsiveFilter(0.25);
	
	//create an EWMA filter with an initial sensor reading
	double initialSensorData = sensor.getReading();
	LouLib::Filters::EWMAFilter filter(0.1, initialSensorData);
	
Using the EWMA Filter
---------------------

The :code:`EWMAFilter` can be used by calling the :code:`addReading` and :code:`getOutput` methods:

.. code-block:: cpp

	//Create a new EWMA Filter
	LouLib::Filters::EWMAFilter filter(10);

	while(true){

		//Get raw data from sensor
		double rawData = sensor.getReading();

		//Filter the data
		filter.addReading(rawData);
		double filteredData = filter.getOutput();

	}

After running the above code, :code:`filteredData` should contain the data after being filtered by the EWMA Filter.
