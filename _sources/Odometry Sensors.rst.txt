Odometry Sensors
================

LouLib contains three different classes that represent sensors that can be
used for odometry

Rotation Sensor
===============

The :code:`OdomRotationSensor` class is used to represent a odometry dead-wheel
with a VEX V5 rotation sensor.

Creating a rotation sensor
--------------------------

The constructor for :code:`OdomRotationSensor` takes three arguments:

* :code:`int port`
	The port that the sensor is plugged into

* :code:`bool reversed`
	Whether or not the direction of the sensor needs to be reversed

* :code:`LouLib::Units::Length wheelDiam`
	The diameter of the tracking wheel

Adding a gear ratio
-------------------

If the odometry dead-wheel contains gears between the sensor shaft and the
wheel shaft, the :code:`setGearRatio` method is used to ensure the
:code:`OdomRotationSensor` returns accurate values. This method takes two
arguments:

* :code:`int wheelSide`
	The number of teeth on the gear attatched to the same
  	shaft as the tracking wheel
	
* :code:`int sensorSide`
	The number of teeth on the gear attatched to the same
  	shaft as the rotation sensor.
	
Motor Sensor
============

The :code:`OdomMotorSensor` class is used to represent a drive wheel being
used as an odometry tracking wheel.

Creating a motor sensor
-----------------------

The constructor for :code:`OdomMotorSensor` takes four arguments:

* :code:`int motorPort`
	The port the motor is plugged into

* :code:`pros::motor_gearset_e_t gearset`
	The pros gearset of the motor

* :code:`bool motorReversed`
	Whether or not the direction of the motor needs to be reversed

* :code:`LouLib::Units::Length wheelDiam`
	The diameter of the tracking wheel

Adding a gear ratio
-------------------

If the drive contains gears between the motor shaft and the wheel shaft, the
:code:`setGearRatio` method is used to ensure the :code:`OdomMotorSensor`
returns accurate values. This method takes two arguments:

* :code:`int wheelSide`
	The number of teeth on the gear attatched to the same
	shaft as the wheel

* :code:`int sensorSide`
	The number of teeth on the gear attatched to the same
	shaft as the motor.

IMU Sensor
==========

The :code:`OdomIMUSensor` class is used to represent a VEX V5 rotation sensor
being used as a gyroscope for odometry heading.

Creating an IMU sensor
----------------------

The constructor for :code:`OdomIMUSensor` takes two arguments:

* :code:`int port`
	The port the sensor is plugged into

* :code:`double scale` (optional)
	Sometimes VEX IMU sensors will
	return heading values that aren't accurate, but can be made accurate by
	multiplying the output of the sensor by a scalar. This :code:`scale`
	argument is used to provide the scalar for the IMU sensor being used. If
	no :code:`scale` is provided, it will default to 1 (the default IMU readings).
