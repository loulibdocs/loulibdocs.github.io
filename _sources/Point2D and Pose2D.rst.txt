==================
Point2D and Pose2D
==================

Point2D
=======

The :code:`Point2D` class is used to store a two dimensional point. It
contains two pieces of data:

* :code:`LouLib::Units::Length x`
	The x-position of the point

* :code:`LouLib::Units::Length y`
	The y-position of the point

The :code:`Point2D` class contains a single contructor that requires both
:code:`x` and :code:`y`.

The :code:`Point2D` class also contains standard getters and setters for
:code:`x` and :code:`y`.

Pose2D
======

The :code:`Pose2D` class is used to store a two dimensional pose. It contains
three pieces of data:

* :code:`LouLib::Units::Length x`
	The x-position of the pose

* :code:`LouLib::Units::Length y`
	The y-position of the pose

* :code:`LouLib::Units::Angle theta`
	The heading of the pose

The :code:`Pose2D` class contains a single constructor that requires
:code:`x`, :code:`y`, and :code:`theta`.

The :code:`Pose2D` class also contains standard getters and setters for
:code:`x`, :code:`y`, and :code:`theta`.
