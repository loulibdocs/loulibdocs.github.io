LQR Controller
==============

The :code:`LQRController` class is used to create a Linear Quadratic Regulator
controller, a state-space controller that can be applied to any system.

Overview of State-space control
===============================

State-space notation
--------------------

A dynamical system is any system whose motion can be described as a set of
differential equations. Almost all systems in VEX can be classified as linear systems
because the differential equations describing their motion can be written using only
linear operators. Even for systems that aren't exactly linear, a reasonably accurate
linear model of the system can often be constructed.

State-space notation is the way that these models are written. In state-space, the
state, inputs, and outputs of a system can all be written as vectors. Since these
vectors are related to each other by a set of linear differential equations, the
mappings between the state, inputs, and ouputs can be put into matrix form. This
allows for systems to be written as follows:

.. math::
	\dot{\mathbf{x}} = A \mathbf{x} + B \mathbf{u}
	
	\mathbf{y} = C \mathbf{x} + D \mathbf{u}
	
where :math:`\mathbf{x}` is the state vector, :math:`\mathbf{u}` is the input vector,
:math:`\mathbf{y}` is the output vector, and :math:`A`, :math:`B`, :math:`C`,
and :math:`D` are matrices that are specific to the system.

Controllability
---------------

A system is controllable if it can be driven from any state to any other state by
a finite sequence of admissable inputs. A model is controllable if and only if:

.. math::
	\text{rank}(\begin{bmatrix}B & AB & A^2B & \dots & A^{n-1}B\end{bmatrix}) = n
 
where :math:`n` is the number of state variables.

If the matrix above is not full-rank, that means that the inputs cannot apply
tranforms along the entirety of the state-space, making the system not controllable.
All systems used in VEX are controllable with the correct state-space model.

Linear Quadratic Regulator
--------------------------

If a system is controllable, then the control law
:math:`\mathbf{u}=K(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x})`, where :math:`\mathbf{r}` is the
reference, can be used to drive the system to the reference.

A linear quadratic regulator is used to find the most optimal gain
matrix(:math:`K`) by solving the following cost function which weights the sum of
error and control effort over time:

.. math::
	J = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty}({\mathbf{x}^T Q \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{u}^T R \mathbf{u}})dt
	
The value of :math:`K` that minimizes this cost function is:

.. math::
	K = R^{-1}(B^TP(t)+N^T)
	
where :math:`P` is found by solving the discrete time algebraic Ricatti
equation:

.. math::
	P = A^TPA-(A^TPB)(R+B^TPB)^{-1}(B^TPA)+Q

Creating an LQR Controller
=========================

The constructor for :code:`LQRController` requires four different
matrices: :math:`A`, :math:`B`, :math:`Q`, and `R`, where :math:`A` and
:math:`B` are from the state-space representation of the system and :math:`Q`
and :math:`R` are weighting matrices in the LQR cost function.

The constructor will automatically use these four matrices to calculate the
optimal gain matrix for the controller.

Using the LQR Controller
========================

The LQR Controller can be used by calling the :code:`setReference` and
:code:`computeControl` method.

:code:`setReference` is used to set the target state of the controller.

:code:`computeControl` is used to calculate the optimal control inputs for
the given state.

.. note::
	The :code:`setReference` method must be called at least once before using
	the :code:`computeControl` method, otherwise there will be no target state
	for the controller.
	
The :code:`LQRController` class also contains the :code:`getK` method
that can be used to access the calculated gain matrix.
