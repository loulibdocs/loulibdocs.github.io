Welcome to LouLib!
==================================

LouLib is a library for autonomous programming of VEX robots.

The library contains classes for different controllers and systems that make
autonomous programming easier. The library also contains math, unit analysis, and
utility classes to make programming your own controllers easier.

Getting Started
---------------

**1. Download the library**

The library can be downloaded from the `releases page of the Github repo <https://github.com/klou23/LouLib/releases>`_.
You can download either the `.zip` or the `tar.gz`.

**2. Add the library to the project**

Rename the unzipped directory, to :code:`LouLib` (delete the version number from the
directory name). This :code:`LouLib` directory
should then be added to :code:`src` directory of your PROS project.

**3. Include LouLib**

Use the :code:`#include` directive to include the :code:`LouLib/LouLib.hpp` file in any source
files that you wish to used LouLib in.

**4. Use namespace (optional)**

If you wish to use LouLib without needing to type out the namespace names, you can add
:code:`#define USE_LOULIB_NAMESPACES` before you include :code:`LouLib/LouLib.hpp`.
If you decide to use the LouLib namespace, it is recommended that you don't use the
pros or okapi namespaces to prevent overlapping names.
