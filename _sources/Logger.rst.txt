The :code:`Logger` class is used to log data to the SD card in the VEX brain.

Creating a Logger
-----------------

There are three different ways to create a new logger:

1. Create a logger with no parameters (will write to log.txt):

.. code-block:: cpp
	
	//Create a new logger that writes to log.txt
	LouLib::Utility::Logger logger;

2. Create a logger with a file name:

.. code-block:: cpp

	//Create a new logger that writes to file.txt
	std::string fileName = "file";
	LouLib::Utility::Logger logger(fileName);
	
3. Create a logger with a file name and file extension:

.. code-block:: cpp

	//Create a new logger that writes to file.csv
	std::string fileName = "file";
	std::string fileExtension = "csv";
	LouLib::Utility::Logger logger(fileName, fileExtension);

.. admonition:: Note on file names

	If there already exists a file with the same name as what the logger is set
	to write to, the logger will write to a new file with a number added to the
	file name.
	
	For example, if `log.txt` already exists, a new logger would write to
	`log(1).txt`, and creating another logger after that would result in a logger
	that writes to `log(2).txt`.
